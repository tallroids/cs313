After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://rocky-shelf-18707.herokuapp.com/spotter

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/tallroids/cs313/tree/master/web/spotter

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
UPDATE: Registration form is now functional, so login credentials can be created by yourself. This queries the database to see if a user exists before creating it. 
New locations can also be made. This uses Google's maps API to get coordinates from a dropped pin. The query is then sent to insert the row into the database.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Passwords will be hashed in the future

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
It is neat to see how flexible PDO statements are, and how they can be resued. 

6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?
It is nice to have that relationship to assist in form creation, so users don't have to type in everything.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I think that using the google maps api to create a location is pretty ingenuitive. It was fun to get working.
